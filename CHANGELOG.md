  - **api:** Add CheckPackages and CheckSingleProject functions to check packages and their dependencies for updates The CheckPackages function loads packages and their dependencies, filters out private dependencies, and checks each package for updates. The CheckSingleProject function checks a single package for updates and writes the updated package to the package.json file if the write option is set to true. These functions are used in the check command to check for updates in packages and their dependencies. ([e945b89](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/e945b89))
  - **io): add functions to read, write and load package.json files, and resolve dependencies ‚ú® feat(io:** Add functions to read, write and load package.json files, and resolve dependencies This commit adds new functions to read, write and load package.json files, and resolve dependencies. The `readJSON` and `writeJSON` functions are used to read and write package.json files respectively. The `loadPackage` function is used to load a package.json file and parse its dependencies. The `loadPackages` function is used to load all package.json files in a directory and its subdirectories. The `resolveDependency` function is used to resolve a dependency and determine if it needs to be updated. The `resolveDependencies` function is used to resolve all dependencies of a package. The `resolvePackage` function is used to resolve all dependencies of a package and sort them by their update status. The `getPackageMode` function is used to get ([e07f90e](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/e07f90e))
  - **utils:** Add new files dependenciesFilter.ts, diff.ts, npm.ts, npmcliConfig.d.ts The `dependenciesFilter.ts` file contains utility functions to filter dependencies based on include and exclude patterns. The `diff.ts` file contains a map of semantic versioning strings to numbers. The `npm.ts` file contains a function to get the npm configuration. The `npmcliConfig.d.ts` file contains the type definitions for the `npmcliConfig` module. ([286ac60](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/286ac60))
  - **versions.ts:** Add utility functions for version range prefixing, changing version range, and getting the maximum satisfying version This commit adds utility functions for version range prefixing, changing version range, and getting the maximum satisfying version.

The functions are getVersionRangePrefix, changeVersionRange, applyVersionRangePrefix, getPrefixedVersion, and getMaxSatisfying. ([d3ea861](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/d3ea861))
  - **sort.ts:** Add utility functions to sort dependency changes by time, diff, or name This commit adds a new file `sort.ts` that contains utility functions to sort dependency changes by time, diff, or name. The `sortDepChanges` function takes an array of `ResolvedDepChange` objects and a `SortOption` string, which is parsed to determine the sort key and order. The function then sorts the array based on the specified key and order and returns the sorted array. The `parseSortOption` function is used to split the `SortOption` string into its key and order components. ([94d00a8](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/94d00a8))
  - **toArray.ts:** Add utility function toArray to convert a value to an array The new utility function toArray takes a value and returns an array containing the value if it is not already an array. If the value is undefined or null, an empty array is returned. This function can be used to ensure that a value is always an array, which can be useful in cases where an array is expected but a single value may be passed. ([605cabf](https://github.com/nyxblabs/freshdeps/commit/605cabf))
  - **time.ts:** Add timeDifference and toDate functions to calculate time difference and convert date string to number The timeDifference function calculates the time difference between two dates and returns a string representation of the difference in days, months, or years. The toDate function converts a date string to a number. These functions are useful for displaying relative time in a user-friendly way.
